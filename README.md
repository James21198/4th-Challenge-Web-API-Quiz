# 4th-Challenge-Web-API-Quiz

## What motivated me and what was my goal?

In this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a fully functional quiz in which I believe I have accomplished by ensuring that when the start button is clicked on the first page that it then smoothly transitions to the questions with an activate 30 second timer that goes down over time and also deducts 5 seconds when you click an incorrect answer.

I have also ensured that once the user finishes the quiz that the timer stops counting down. In addition if the user runs out of time on the quiz I have made sure that it jumps to the display result section and ends the quiz. I have also ensured that when the user finishes the quiz that they are also able to save their initials into the local storage which then shows their initials for example, JR and the score the user received on the quiz.

Finally i have also ensured that when the user clicks on their answer for the current question they are on that they are then moved onto the next question of the quiz until the timer or quiz is over.
